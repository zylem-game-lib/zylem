# Commit Guide

This is a guide for committing to the repository.

## Conventional commits

We use conventional commits to help with release management.

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `cleanup`: Removal of dead code, unused functionality, or code changes involving renaming
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: vite, npm, typescript, etc)
- `refinement`: General improvements to the codebase that do not fall into any of the above categories.
